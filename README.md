## Plant Hackathon
Learn by doing hackathon for high-throughput phenotyping, programming, and statistics, and plant biology, education.

General Description: 
Every participant is both a master of their subject area and NOOB at either computing or biology. Participants coming from a non-computer background will first attend a [Software Carpentry Workshop](http://software-carpentry.org/). Participants from a CS background will first attend a biology short course covering key concepts in plant biology as outlined in the [ASPB education](http://my.aspb.org/?Education) handbook. There is an opportunity here to develop accelerated curriculum for plant biology to show why plants are fascinating to a general tech savvy audience and attract talent interested in plant related research problems. 

Space Rules: One room divided into two halves. The the learning half (blue) and the data half (red). Each half of the room has five themed tables: The blue tables are hardware, cloud computing, databases, image processing, data modeling. The red tables are are divided into the following classes: 3 tables have unsolved image based phenotyping problems, 1 table has solved image based phenotyping problems, 1 table is BYOD (bring your own data).

Time Rules: We need to have some initial starting conditions where people have a table to start at and need to stay there for at least X min. (1) each person is paired with another person based on their response to a questionnaire (learning objectives). They will not need to stay together for the whole event (1-2.5 days) but will we will cycle between pairs of people and have a duration where you get to float on your own. 

Details and side rules: Each "code bum" will be paired with another "code bum". Pairing will be done based on learning objectives. There will be two prizes for the "code guns", 1) Top prize will be for the code gun who gets the most tokens 2) Second Prize for the "code gun" who solves the unsolved problem. 5 Tokens will be given out to each "code bum" and they will deposit those tokens into a box with the name of the "code gun" who outlines a concept for them. The "Code Gun" who earns the most tokens wins something.

All teams will present 5 minutes at the end what their learning goals were and what was accomplished over the 48 hours. General prizes will be awarded for most creative quant/plant biologist team (this can be fleshed out better). Small poster templates will be filled out and printed to show off at the ICAR meeting poster session. The purpose of this is to show the general community to see how creative people can get when there is a severe time constraint. This also should alleviate some of the anxiety and killer of creativity: perfectionism.

## Solved Problems
This is for the plant biologists to try coding some solutions to solve an already solved problem. 

#### Mild
(1) Reading image data and visualizing it in Matlab or Python

(2) Image Anatomy

(3) Build histograms of images

### Medium 
(1) Change color space

(2) Finding image edges

(3) Writing a function over images

### Spicy 
(1) Deploy solution in the cloud

(2) Image registration

(3) Optical Flows

## Anticipated Outcomes
The entire purpose of this is for each type of learner to meet their learning objectives and have a small "product" at the end to show what can be accomplished in just a short period of time. A side effect of this interaction will be the CS and plant community developing a common language by learning and immediately applying that knowledge to the respective disciplines. Furthermore this common language can be refined over time through additional hackathons at plant and CS meetings. 

Small participant surveys will be produced for before and after to assess learning.

## Human Considerations
*    Number of participants
*    Code of conduct [Example 1](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/), [Example 2](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment)
*    Child Care?
*    Advertising at plant meetings
*    Advertising at CS meetings
*    Napping Space for participants
*    Beer

## Teaching Considerations
We need representation of CS, biology, engineering, and educators.

## Computer Considerations
*    Industrial grade internet connection
*    CyVerse
*    TACC Access
*    Install resources help at Software Carpentry?
*    Raspberry Pi with Camera modules?

## Funding Considerations
*    ICAR [X]
*    ASPB Education Grant?
*    Bill and Melinda Gates?
*    Lemnatech?
*    Amazon Education
*    Google
